          "title": "Glossy",
          "description": "This finish uses an opaque white base material with a glossy coating that enhances colour vibrancy and sharpness. The shiny surface catches the light, making your badge pop with brightness. However, because the material itself is glossy, it slightly diffuses the reflection on the printed area, giving a balanced sheen without excessive glare.",

          "title": "Matte",
          "description": "The matte finish features a pre-laminated material that reduces glare and gives your badge a soft, elegant appearance. While it offers less shine than glossy, it still allows some reflection from the ink’s sheen, creating a refined, subtle look that’s perfect for modern and minimalist designs.",
